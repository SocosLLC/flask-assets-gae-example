# flask-assets-gae

Example code for using flask-assets in Google App Engine

## Setup

Make sure you have pip, virtualenv, and the
[Google App Engine SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/download)

Run `./setup.sh` to create the Python virtualenv and create assets.

Run `./run_dev.sh` to run the dev server and rebuild when assets files are changed.
